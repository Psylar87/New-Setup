# New Machine Setup
> Note: For anyone suggesting to use Ansible, this setup works for my needs. I don't require all the options provided by Ansible, nor do I want to do the extra setup.

Steps to make a new machine easier to setup

## Sign into iCloud and enable documents to be synced.
## Run the script found in the script folder, or follow the manual process below.
## Insatll HomeBrew
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"

## Add brew to PATH for zsh
```
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> ~/.zshrc
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

### Then pass in the Brewfile location...
```
brew bundle --file [clone loaction]/Brewfile
```

### ...or move to the directory first.
```
cd [clone loaction] && brew bundle
```

## Restore App settings, .zshrc, & .gitconfig using Mackup
### In our case, the files are all backed up via iCloud. As a note, at the time of backing up on March 4, 2024, the symlink on macOS 14 seems to be broken and does not allow the linked files to be read correctly.
### Configure the storage
  ```shell
  nvim ~/.mackup.cfg
  ```
Add this 
```ini 
[storage]
engine = icloud
```
Save

### Restore

```
mackup restore --force && mackup uninstall --force
```

As of writing, this is the best way, as it is somewhat broken on macOS 14, due to broken symlinks.
